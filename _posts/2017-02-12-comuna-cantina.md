If you’re after authentic international food, it is fair to say that shopping mall food courts are not the place to go. After all the image of an overcrowded, unventilated row of fast food takeaway outlets serving grease and sugar has been so permanently seared into our collective consciousness that it hardly elicits an image of excitement. 

But that is exactly what Cantina’s food is - <em>Exciting</em>. Located in the new eatery precinct in the recently developed section of Pacific Fair (which as an aside, is really worth a visit in it’s own right), Cantina is a small eatery serving some tasty South American fare. 

Now as a disclaimer, I have never been to South America and as such can’t say for sure how close this is to the real thing, but what I can definitely stand behind is that this is not your average Mad Mex.

<b>Service &amp; atmosphere</b>

For starters the service is fabulous. Our server was bright and enthusiastic, physically sat down and walked us through the entire menu, made excellent recommendations based on our tastes and hunger levels. Going above and beyond in this department really sets the mood for an enjoyable evening. 

<b>Food</b>

Let me just preface this with the fact that there are definitely some dishes that are better than others, and I suspect a large part of how enjoyable the food is, is what you order and how much you’re willing to pay. Most things we got, purely in terms of taste were solid. Some things were amazing (the tacos) and some not so amazing (the ice cream sandwich).

The tacos were by far the standout. Light, fresh and such interesting flavours. We ordered the grilled chicken, pulled beef and prawn tacos. Each one was well seasoned. The tortillas were soft and fresh, all three types of protein were cooked perfectly, the sauces were all great. 10/10 for taste, my only gripe was that they were quite small.

We got the prawn arepa ($11), and are not the hot pockets that they advertise them to be. The flavours are nice though. The pineapple salsa and coriander worked really well with the prawns, which themselves are lightly battered and fried to tender crispy morsels. Could use some more salt, but I have a heavy palate.

The steak churrasco ($19) was solid. You can’t go wrong with steak. It comes out medium well-done (they don’t ask you for your preference), which is a few shades darker than the medium/medium-rare I normally order my steaks at. Comes with an amazing chimichurri sauce that honestly makes this dish worth the money. Apart from that it comes with a small amount of standard salad, some black beans and quinoa that are purposely unseasoned I suspect to ground the dish. You probably need to enjoy clean eating to really appreciate this. The flavours are really light, clean and perfect if you’re after something that doesn’t make you feel bad after eating it.

Dessert was the weakest dish of the night. The ice cream sandwich ($9) was terrible. The Ice-cream came as a melted puddle in a ramekin next to two cardboard tasting cookies. I’m not joking they are the worst tasting cookies I have ever eaten and not worth the calories. Save your stomach for something else. The fried bananas w/ ice cream ($8) were slightly better. Battered in a coconut and crumb mixture and then deep fried, they were also served with (melted) ice-cream on the side. These were more worth the price (although you’re still better off going somewhere else for dessert).

<b>Value for money</b>

This is the big clincher. The desserts are poor value for money, especially the ice-cream sandwich which I would not eat even if it was free. The main meals are more worth it, but still expensive for what they are. Even the standout dish - $6-$7.50 per taco is a hefty amount to pay for a taco, no matter how good it tastes. Expensive but still worth it in my own personal opinion.  My best advice is to wait for specials or promotions which they seem to often run. When we went, they were running promotional vouchers of $50 worth of value for $25. They also run promotions on discount sites. Get yourself a voucher and go hard on the tacos, they’re more than worth it if you’re paying half price.
